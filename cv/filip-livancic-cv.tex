\section*{Work Experience}
\vspace{-2.5mm}

\subsection*{\textbf{Fifty Five - Senior Data Engineer} \hfill  Sep 2024 - Mar 2025}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Maintained and developed GCP architecture for clients which provides analytics around media and marketing insights.
    \item Built Python API ingestion pipeline for illness-related Google search trends and weather data history into GCS with subsequent loading into BigQuery; this supported a ML model predicting ideal marketing campaign time-frames for pharmaceutical client.
    \item Implemented an ELT process with Python into a GCP data warehouse featuring Cloud Logging, modelled BigQuery data with dbt and SQL to analyse hospitality loyalty figures, tracking booking-to-stay conversion rates across hotel locations.
    \item Audited client's BigQuery project with 300+ tables, recommending cleanup of abandoned pipelines, reducing table count by 75\% and resulting in improved capacity for maintenance.
    \item Patched problematic GA4 pipeline for client by utilising event-driven logic in conjunction with Pub/Sub message triggers to accurately order pipeline sequencing; backfilled data to re-populate affected periods.
    \item Resolved dbt DAG failures caused by unexpected data source changes, troubleshooting Airflow and BigQuery, communicating resolutions to clients, backfilling data and restoring sales analytics in Looker.
    \item Revised GitLab repositories by incorporating a CI/CD Terraform (IaC) workflow which updates GCP infrastructure and pipelines.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\textbf{Sky - Data Visualisation Engineer} \hfill  Dec 2022 - Sep 2024}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Developed BigQuery data models for numerous projects to enable the visualisation team to produce analytics on: customers, product holdings, technology types, subscription flows, order flows and contract data.
    \item Monitored aggregated view of customers with broadband speed issues in Tableau, measured the percentage of customers churning in response to inconveniences in different time-frames.
    \item Analysed broadband discount strategies in Tableau and was successfully able to measure the effectiveness of offers contributing to subscription acquisitions and churn reduction.
    \item Migrated SQL transformation scripts from dedicated servers to the GCP BigQuery data warehouse, implementing SQL best practices for readability, and performing regression tests to assure high data quality.
    \item Supported the implementation of common staging pipelines to optimise data processing volumes, resulting in a significant reduction of duplicate processing costs and creating a single source of truth.
    \item Prioritised and triaged ad-hoc requests from stakeholders, created gcloud bash scripts (bq, gsutil) to export data into GCS buckets to stay agile whilst handling larger projects.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\textbf{easyJet - Safety Data Analyst} \hfill  Nov 2021 - Nov 2022}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Collaborated with safety experts to develop Tableau dashboards tracking incident statistics across Flight, Engineering, Cabin, and Ground Operations, improving visibility of safety risks.
    \item Automated manual reports with Python (pandas, matplotlib, xlsxwriter) by creating burst-reporting pipelines and saving 30 man-hours per month. 
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-3.5mm}

\subsection*{\textbf{TUI Airways - Engineering Safety Analyst} \hfill  Aug 2018 - Sep 2021}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Chaired the monthly Engineering Safety Action Group (ESAG), presenting safety trend analyses and ensuring senior management addressed risks to airworthiness and operational readiness.
  \item Creating Python scripts (pandas, matplotlib) for analysing trending safety incidents across Engineering \& Maintenance (E\&M).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\textbf{Chess ETL Pipeline} | \href{https://github.com/Filpill/chess_analysis}{\faGithub\ Filpill/chess\_analysis}  \hfill  Mar 2025 – Jul 2025}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Ingested historical data monthly from the chess.com API using Python; landing in GCS and loaded incrementally into BigQuery.
  \item Integrated GitHub Actions and Terraform for CI/CD deployment (Buckets, Schedulers, Cloud Run, Sinks, Triggers, etc).
  \item Developed Cloud Run Services which use Pub/Sub messages triggers for launching VM Instances to run ETL jobs.
\end{itemize}
